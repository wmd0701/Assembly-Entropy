# Assembly-Entropy

This is the repo for practice course IN0035 Aspekte der systemnahen Programmierung bei der Spielenentwicklung, 2017/18 WS, TUM. The goal is to implement **an approximation for entropy**. A bonus is to impelement a faster version. 

The target plattform of this project is Raspberry Pi (provided by TUM Info Fakult√§t). The programming languages are **Assembly** and **C**. 

***PS:*** After Mengdi's graduation from TUM, his TUM account becomes invalid and access to the original repo on [LRZ GitLab](https://gitlab.lrz.de/users/sign_in) is lost. This repo on GitHub is created afterwards and only keeps some Latex source files which are used to generate the report.
